In the realm of industrial manufacturing, detecting defects in products is critical for maintaining quality. Traditional
methods relying on human inspection are often error-prone and time-consuming. However, advancements
in automation and computer vision have led to smarter industrial control systems. This paper explores
a novel approach to identifying defects in industrial processes by integrating OPC-UA and YOLO v8. OPCUA
provides a secure communication standard, enabling seamless data exchange between devices, while
YOLO v8 provides accurate object detection. By combining these technologies, manufacturers can monitor
production lines in near real-time, analyze defects promptly, and take corrective actions. As a result,
product quality and operational efficiency are improved. A case study involving tinplate lid defect detection
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The system architecture, including PLC integration,
image acquisition, and YOLO v8 implementation, is detailed, followed by the performance evaluation of the
OPC-UA server and YOLO v8 model integration. Results indicate efficient communication with low Round
Trip Times, highlighting the potential of this approach for defect detection. The code is available at GitHub:
